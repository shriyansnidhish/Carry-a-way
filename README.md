# Carry-a-way
The idea of Carry-A-way is to provide users with a cheap, convenient, step-by-step tracking and messaging enabled shipping facility for their checkin luggage/item/sports/music kit etc. through courier service of their choice and get it picked/delivered at their origin/destination doorstep. All in just few clicks.<br/>
Carry-A-way is a web application developed using Go and Angular which allows users to travel hassle free without a worry of carrying bulky luggage/items and paying heavy charges to airlines.
